# Metallurgical Portfolio - Grev Manurung

Hello! I'm a Metallurgical Engineering student interested in manufacturing and mining.
Here are some projects and simulations I've worked on:

-  **Comminution Simulation (Jaw Crusher, Roll Crusher, Ball Mill)** â€” using MATLAB & Excel.
-  **Metal Casting Results Analysis** â€” the effect of temperature and composition on microstructure.
-  **Iron Ore Reduction Calculation** â€” based on reaction kinetics data.

ðŸ’» Software Used: MATLAB, Simulink, SolidWorks, Origin, Excel.
